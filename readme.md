# Brige Ratings

Knowing a bridge player's skill is crucial to finding good partners and assigning credit, yet existing ways that bridge players are ranked are not very effective. This repository houses work-in-progress code to address this problem by evaluating alternative methods of ranking bridge players.

# Status

Currently, the repository ranks bridge players using an ELO-based ranking. However, evaluations are showing shockingly low (chance-level) prediction accuracy for this model. It is possible that there is an issue with the dataset, or, that ranking bridge players is more difficult than it appear.
